#Friendbook API - A Java REST api driven by an in-memory db

## this app uses the following REST api [be.friendbook.api](https://github.com/kaspercools/be.friendbook.api)

Friendbook API was created to demonstrate the use of a REST api in a distributed setup, creating the ability to share and send data from an [iOS app](https://github.com/kaspercools/be.friendbook.ios) to a Java backend and viewing that same data in an [Angular app](https://github.com/kaspercools/be.friendbook.ng2)
